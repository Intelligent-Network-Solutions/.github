## Projects

### **Cloud-Based Telemetry-Driven Software-Defined Network**
Our primary project focuses on leveraging cloud-based telemetry to enhance the capabilities of software-defined networks.

#### Key Components:
- **Telemetry-Driven Load Balancer (SNeLB)**: A load balancer that dynamically adapts based on real-time telemetry data.
- **Reconstruction of Generated Telemetry Data**: A mechanism for rebuilding and optimizing the network's generated telemetry data.
